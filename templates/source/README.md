# Dots: Overlay Source template

This is a template for creating a dots overlay source.

## Getting Started

To get started, open the `src/config.js` file give your component a label. This can only be lower alphanumeric characters and dashes. It must be uniquely named from any other components you or others have create so id recommend labeling it in the format of `feature-version-author` (eg. `chat-1-dotmrjosh`).

Once you've configured your source, head to the `src/Component.svelte` file where you can start coding! If this is your first time programming, I'd recommend checking out [MDNs HTML basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics).

If you're already familiar with HTML but are unfamiliar with Svelte, I'd recommend checking out the official [Sveltes tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) to take advantage of all its features.

## Building

To build your source, run the following command:

```bash
bun run build

# If you're using npm
npm run build
```
